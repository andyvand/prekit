NOTICE
=========
The source code here is orignal come from OTC android project.
The mapping between them looks like below.

OTC android src tree                    source directory
system/core/fastboot                    .

How to build and install?
=========================
This project use GNU Autotools as build system, so it's quite simple to build it
like below:

$ autoreconf -i (if you're using git source tree)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

For more advanced usage, please refer to INSTALL.


How to build for Windows?
=========================
First, you need install cross compile toolchain, the below take mingw as
example.

# apt-get install gcc-mingw32
$ ./configure --build x86_64-linux-gnu --host i686-w64-mingw32
$ make

There is a simple way to figure out what should "--build" and "--host" should
be in your case.

For "--build", just run
$ ./config.guess

For "--host", this is the prefix of your cross compile toolchain, for me, it
i686-w64-mingw32.

After compile finished, you'll find fastboot.exe and usbtest.exe in current
directory.

NOTE: to use them on Windows, you need install correct usb drivers.
